"""
The purpose of this file (operations.py) is to handle any file operations in this program. For window management, see main.py. 

Issues: Python is slow, and these custom maps range from 5 to 30 gigabytes. So, we will use system calls so that Windows
        will copy/delete the files for us. 

        # Important functionality
        # If someone tries to close the window while copying is taking place, it should cancel the copy.
            # I don't know if I actually need to implement this myself or if this is already how it is with python system calls.
