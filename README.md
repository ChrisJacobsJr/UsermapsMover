# BOIII Usermaps manager
### Automates a manual step required when playing custom maps on the BOIII client for Call of Duty Black Ops 3.

The plan is to have easily buildable python code with instructions, as well as an executable file for those who cannot code (If you've come this far, you probably have what it takes).
<br>It will use tkinter for a GUI.<br><br>

## Here's the plan so far
### Phase 0 (we are here)
Define the other phases in detail and set expectations for what should be implemented in each phase.
### Phase 1
#### Barebones functionality. 
+ Copying and Deleting of the maps will be implemented in this phase. It will be done by typing the map name into the search bar and pushing a submit button.
### Phase 2
#### Quality of Life Features
+ Here we add two boxes
    + One for the maps in the steam workshop folder
    + One for the maps in the usermaps folder
+ Above the two boxes are a bar for the file path of the folders
    + The file locations are saved to a text file to be read next time
+ We have buttons for copying/deleting individually selected maps
### Phase 3
#### Making it polished
+ Add a button that opens a folder dialog to select each folder
    + Try to guess where the folders are
### Phase 4
#### Exe release
+ Write detailed build instructions
+ Make an executable
+ Find some way to have persistent data without writing to a txt file
